Clearly, the origin is a fixed point but there may be more fixed points depending on the nonlinear functions $h_{i}(\\cdot)$. **Prove that** the origin is AS.\n\nTo do this, motivated by the pendulum example in Lec. 3, p. 13-14 and Lec. 4, p. 1-2, consider the Lyapunov function $V(x_1,x_2) = \\int_{0}^{x_1}h_1(y)\\:{\\rm{d}}y + \\frac{1}{2}x_2^2$. This Lyapunov function can be thought of as a generalized energy: the intergal term is a generalized potential energy and the second summand is a generalized kinetic energy. You may need to use the LaSalle invariance.\n\n(ii) Let us consider a specific instance of the above given by\n$$\\dot{x}_{1} = x_{2}, \\qquad \\dot{x}_{2} = -\\alpha x_1^3 - \\beta x_2, \\qquad \\alpha,\\beta>0.$$\n**Prove that** the origin for this system is in fact GAS.",

This will lead to an inequality involving the gain upper bound $\\gamma$, the scaling and the parameters. Requiring $\\gamma$ to be smallest will yield the optimal scaling.)",
