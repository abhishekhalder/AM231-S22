To mathematically model this system, we represent both the car and the trailers as having two driving wheels connected by an axle, as shown in Fig. 2.\n<img src=\"TarilerModel.png\" width=\"700\">\n<center>Figure 2: Model of a car with $n$ trailers. The inertial coordinate system is denoted as $(i_x,i_y)$.</center>\n<br />\nEach trailer is hooked up in the middle point of the axle of the previous body by a rigid bar of length $\\ell = 1$. To describe the state, we fix an inertial coordinate system, shown in the left bottom corner of Fig. 2. Notice that the connecting rod is parallel to the wheels since the rod + axle for any trailer is a rigid assembly.\n\nSuppose $(x, y)$ is the coordinate of the mid-point of the axle of the last trailer; $\\theta_n$ is the angle that the car’s pair of wheels make with the inertial horizontal axis; and $\\theta_{i}$, $0\\leq i \\leq n − 1$, is the angle that the $(n − i)$-th trailer’s pair of wheels make with the inertial horizontal axis. The state vector of the system is\n\n$$\\underline{x} := \\left(x,y,\\theta_{0},\\theta_{1}, ..., \\theta_{n}\\right)^{\\top}.$$\n\nThe control vector consists of the car’s translational velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\\omega$, i.e., $\\underline{u} := (v, \\omega)^{\\top}$.\n\nThe wheels of each body (1 car and $n$ trailers) are constrained to roll without slipping, i.e., the velocity of each body is parallel to the direction of its wheels. Let $f_{n} := 1$, and\n$$\nf_{i}:=\\cos \\left(\\theta_{i+1}-\\theta_{i}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\theta_{i+2}-\\theta_{i+1}\\right) \\ldots \\cos \\left(\\theta_{n}-\\theta_{n-1}\\right)=\\prod_{j=i+1}^{n} \\cos \\left(\\theta_{j}-\\theta_{j-1}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq i \\leq n-1.\n$$",
